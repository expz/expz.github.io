I was a postdoc at ETH working with [Brent Doran](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=fxzOPf8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Matthias Christandl](http://www.math.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/475476). My doctoral work was done at the University of Zurich under [Andrew Kresch](https://www.mathuzh.ch/index.php?id=people&key1=1287).

I am no longer in academia, but you can find my papers on this site. My work was in algebraic geometry.

I also enjoy doing machine learning, especially reinforcement learning, in my spare time, and I have a great admiration for the [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) language and its community. Some of my projects are available at my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/expz) including [a collection](https://github.com/expz/spin-class) of single file implementations of common RL algorithms.
