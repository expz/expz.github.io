I was a postdoc at ETH working with [Brent Doran](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~doranb/) and [Matthias Christandl](http://www.math.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/475476). My doctoral work was done at the University of Zurich under [Andrew Kresch](http://www.math.uzh.ch/index.php?professur&key1=1287).

I am no longer in academia, but you can find my papers here. My interest is in algebraic geometry.

I also enjoy reading and writing [machine learning](https://fast.ai) code in my spare time, and I have a great admiration for the [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) language and its community. A small amount of associated code can be found at my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/expz).
