I was a postdoc at ETH working with [Brent Doran](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~doranb/) and [Matthias Christandl](http://www.math.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/475476). My doctoral work was done at the University of Zurich under [Andrew Kresch](http://www.math.uzh.ch/index.php?professur&key1=1287).

I am no longer in academia, but you can find my papers here. My interest is in algebraic geometry and included a foray into quantum information theory.

I also enjoy reading and writing [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) in my free time. Associated code can be found on GitHub.
